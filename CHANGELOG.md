### Features

- Migrated the build system for the NPM package from Babel (which previously generated multiple minified JS files) to Rollup, producing a single, optimized bundle.
  - Significantly reduced package size by consolidating files and improving tree-shaking.
  - Added native ESM support via modern Rollup outputs for better compatibility with modern bundlers.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.14.0

## 5.13.0 (2025-07-23)

### Features

- Added the [`evaluateAudiences`][evaluateAudiences] method. This method iterates over all Audiences Explorer segments, evaluates each one, and tracks the segments for which the visitor is targeted using the [`TARGETINGSEGMENT`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/apis/data-api-rest/all-endpoints/post-visit-events/) event.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where `defaultDataFile` loaded configuration incorrectly when using the new [v3 data file format](sdk-config.kameleoon.eu/v3/<sitecode>).
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.13.0

[evaluateAudiences]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/nodejs-sdk#evaluateaudiences

## 5.12.1 (2025-07-11)

### Patch Changes

- Stability and performance improvements
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.12.1

## 5.12.0 (2025-07-10)

### Features

- Introducing a fallback configuration mechanism via the [`defaultDataFile`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/nodejs-sdk/#configuration-parameters) parameter. If no cached configuration is available, the SDK immediately uses the provided default. For version control, the SDK prioritizes the default configuration if its `dateModified` timestamp is more recent than the cached version.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.12.0

## 5.11.0 (2025-06-27)

### Features

- Added support for **304 (Not Modified)** responses from the SDK config service to avoid redundant updates and reduce traffic when the configuration hasn't changed.
- Added new optional parameter `instant` to the [`flush`][flush] method, allowing data to be sent to the server immediately without waiting for the next scheduled flush cycle.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.11.0

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.9.2

[SessionMerging]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/nodejs-sdk/#using-custom-data-for-session-merging

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.6.1

## 5.6.0 (2025-02-26)

### Features

- Added SDK support for **Mutually Exclusive Groups**. When feature flags are grouped into a **Mutually Exclusive Group**, only one flag in the group will be evaluated at a time. All other flags in the group will automatically return their default variation.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed validation for the [`networkDomain`][configurationParameters] parameter.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.6.0

## 5.5.0 (2025-02-10)

### Features

- Added SDK support for **holdout experiments**. Visitors assigned to a holdout experiment are excluded from all other rollouts and experiments, and consistently receive the default variation. For visitors not in a holdout experiment, the standard evaluation process applies, allowing them to be evaluated for all feature flags as usual. Platform-wide release expected in February 2025.
- Introduced a new `personalization` parameter to [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`][getRemoteVisitorData]. Default value of the parameter is `false`.
- The following targeting conditions are now supported:
  - Exclusive Campaign
  - Experiment
  - Personalization

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.4.0

## 5.3.0 (2025-01-17)

### Features

- Introduced a new `visitorCode` parameter to [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`][getRemoteVisitorData]. This parameter determines whether to use the `visitorCode` from the most recent previous visit instead of the current `visitorCode`. When enabled, this feature allows visitor exposure to be based on the retrieved `visitorCode`, facilitating [cross-device reconciliation][CrossDevice]. Default value of the parameter is `true`.
- The mapping identifier is now persistent within a visitor session, ensuring that the assigned variation for a visitor remains unchanged when [merging sessions][mergingSessions] between anonymous and registered users.
- Added support for additional Data API servers worldwide, enabling faster network requests when the [`networkDomain`][configurationParameters] is manually configured.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 5.2.0 (2024-12-09)

### Features

- Added support for **simulated** variations.

- Added an optional `onError` handler for [`IExternalEventSource`][iextrnaleventsource] interface. If the `onError` handler is not provided the SDK would not be able to handle Real-Time Update server failures. Note: no action is required when using default Kameleoon event source solutions.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.1.1

[iextrnaleventsource]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/nodejs-sdk/#eventsource

## 5.0.2 (2024-11-08)

### Patch Changes

- Fixed build issue resulting in potential issues when using any targeting condition with `Exclude` option
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.0.2

## 5.0.1 (2024-11-05)

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue with the [`Page URL`][Targeting Conditions] and [`Page Title`][Targeting Conditions] targeting conditions, where the condition evaluated all previously visited URLs in the session instead of only the current URL, corresponding to the latest added `PageView`
  NOTE: This change may impact your existing targeting. Please review your targeting conditions to ensure accuracy.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.0.1

[Targeting Conditions]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/using-visit-history-in-feature-flags-and-experiments#benefits-of-calling-getremotevisitordata

## 5.0.0 (2024-10-03)

### Breaking Changes

- `isUniqueIdentifier` parameter has been removed from methods [`flush`][flush], [`getRemoteVisitorData`][getremotevisitordata] and [`trackConversion`][trackconversion]
- Previously deprecated method [`onConfigurationUpdate`][onconfigurationupdate] has been removed from SDKs. Use [`onEvent`][onevent] method with `EventType.ConfigurationUpdate` to achieve the same effect.
- Previously deprecated field [`domain`][domain] of `SDKConfiguration` has been removed from SDKs. Use [`cookieDomain`][domain] field of `SDKConfiguration` instead.
- Parameter `text` of `KameleoonResponseType` used in custom [`requester`][requester] implementation is now mandatory, for the vast majority of implementations like `fetch`, `axios` or `node-fetch` it won't require any changes.
- SDK stopped using `node-fetch` dependency - that leads to external [`requester`][requester] becoming mandatory dependency. To make sure SDK works correctly make sure to install `@kameleoon/nodejs-requester` package or provide your implementation. Use [`sdk-installer`][sdk-installer] for more detailed information.
- `externalRequestDispatcher` was removed from an SDK - all its functionality can be covered by using custom `requester` implementation.
- SDK parameters [`integrations`][integrations] was removed along with its field [`externalClientConfiguration`][integrations], use custom [`requester`][requester] with [`RequestType.ClientConfiguration`][requesttype] to provide custom configuration instead.
- Static method [`KameleoonUtils.getClientConfigurationUrl`][getclientconfigurationurl] was removed - configuration url can be accessed using [`requester`][requester]

### Features

- Added new [`UniqueIdentifier`][uniqueidentifier] data to be used instead of removed `isUniqueIdentifier` parameters in some methods
- Added new [`SDKConfiguration`][sdkconfiguration] parameter `trackingInterval` to set the interval between SDK tracking network requests in _milliseconds_, default value is 1000, which is also maximum interval, minimum value is 100
- `FeatureVariableType` returned from the methods obtaining feature flag variables can now have two new `VariableType`s - `VariableType.JS` containing a `string` of JavaScript code and `VariableType.CSS` containing a string with CSS code
- Added [`compatibility`][domain] SDK parameter to set the compatibility mode for the SDK, default value is `Compatibility.Node16`, it can also be set to `Compatibility.Node14` or `Compatibility.Node12.

### Patch Changes

- [`getEngineTrackingCode`][getenginetrackingcode] method now correctly sets `triggerExperiment` parameter based on variable types
